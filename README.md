# Template Python Poker Bot
This repo is a template for a Turing Poker bot written in Python. Two sample bots are included.
The first, `main.py`, is a simple bot that always checks or calls. 
The second, `kellycriterion.py`, simulates potential game outcomes to estimate the probability
of winning the current hand, and uses the [Kelly Criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion) to determine the optimal bet size.
